#### Deep Learning Jump Start with Azure Databricks

##### Problem Statement:
###### Build and Train a Deep Convolution Network to Classify Images in the CIFAR10 dataset using Keras on Azure Databricks
<br>
##### The CIFAR-10 dataset:
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of **60000 32x32** colour images in **10 classes**, with **6000** images per class. There are **50000** training images and **10000** test images.

##### **Keras** is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. 
* In this Technical Lab we will use Tensorflow as the backend for Keras

Keras is one of the leading frameworks to build deep learning models, It

1. Allows for easy and fast prototyping (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility).
2. Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.
3. Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.
